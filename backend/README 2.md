# Fat-6-HSBC-Backend
This is the backend for the Fat 6 HSBC Team Vision app. We use a serverless backend hosted through AWS, but this repository contains all of the lambda functions,
and the template to deploy them, and all of the AWS resources we use to host the backend.

The installation guide for the backend can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nXlkb6fZLTfjc2kD4udAzFRv96nh3FMGlw7-plIJI1M/edit?usp=sharing
