# Fat-6-HSBC-Hook-Handler
A 'middle-end' between Zoom WebHooks and our AWS WebSocket API Gateway. This is required because Zoom hooks have no native integration with WebSockets. The server for the hook-handler is hosted at: https://fat6-hook-handler.herokuapp.com

The installation guide for the Hook Hanlder is outlined in section 5 of the backend installation guide here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nXlkb6fZLTfjc2kD4udAzFRv96nh3FMGlw7-plIJI1M/edit?usp=sharing
